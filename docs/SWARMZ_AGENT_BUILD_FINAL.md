# SWARMZ — Final Summary for Agent Build

## What SWARMZ Is
SWARMZ is a governed, embodied, evolving AI runtime that runs real automations and business pipelines using:
- A Partner (visible, evolving operator assistant)
- A Shadow (high-risk executor lane)
- A Swarm of agents (Planner, Coder, Tester, Verifier, Governance, Memory, Reflection)
- A durable runtime (LangGraph, checkpoints, retries, idempotency)
- A product factory (blueprints -> validation -> offers -> checkout -> fulfillment -> ledger)
- A control layer (money, quality, experiments, support, compliance)
- A policy engine (rules that block unsafe or unprofitable actions)
- A ledger spine (append-only financial truth)
- A self-improving loop (sensors -> planning -> execution -> memory -> evolution)

SWARMZ is not a game.
It is a real operational system with a companion interface.

## Partner (Evolving Operator Assistant)
The Partner is a visible AI assistant with traits that grow based on real performance.

### Traits (0-100)
- Logic
- Precision
- Empathy
- Initiative
- Stability

### Tier progression
Tier 0 -> 5 based on trait thresholds and mission success.

Higher tiers unlock:
- Better planning
- More autonomy
- More capabilities
- More advanced forms of assistance

### Partner responsibilities
- Plan missions
- Coordinate agents
- Propose experiments
- Communicate with operator
- Manage low-risk tasks
- Improve through reflection

## Shadow (Tactical Execution Lane)
The Shadow is a controlled, policy-bound executor for high-risk or deep tasks.

### Shadow roles
- Run risky code
- Perform audits
- Detect anomalies
- Execute rollbacks
- Enforce policies
- Self-heal via event replay

### Shadow tiers
Shade -> Wraith -> Reaper -> General -> Monarch
(promoted based on safe, successful execution)

## Agent Layer
Core agents:
- Planner
- Coder
- Tester
- Verifier
- Governance Agent (NIST + OECD + AUS 8)
- Memory Agent (vector DB)
- Reflection Agent (GEA loop)

All run inside LangGraph with checkpoints.

## Blueprint System
Blueprint -> Version -> Validation -> Approval -> Offer -> SKU -> Listing

Includes:
- Artifact storage
- Automated QA
- Policy checks
- Rollback capability

## Store + Checkout
- Catalog
- Cart
- Checkout
- Payment webhook
- Order creation

## Fulfillment
- Digital delivery
- Physical provider adapter
- Tracking updates

## Ledger + Credits
Append-only:
- Revenue
- COGS
- Fees
- Credits
- Withdrawals (optional)

## Control Layer
The survival and governance spine.

### Money controls
- Budget caps
- Spend thresholds
- Profit floor rules

### Quality controls
- Blueprint templates
- QA checks
- Rollback

### Experiment engine
- A/B tests
- KPI gates
- Promotion rules

### Support loop
- Tickets
- Refund automation
- Chargeback rules

### Compliance
- Audit log
- Admin roles
- Data export

### Accounting
- VAT/GST fields
- Profit per SKU
- Cashflow export

### Suppliers + inventory
- Supplier catalog
- Lead times
- RMA flow
- Inventory policy

### Policy-as-code
Declarative rules like:

```txt
no_publish if margin < 20%
require_approval if spend > 50
block if refund_rate > 5% last 30d
```

### Event log + replay
Every action is an event.
System can rebuild state and self-heal.

### Plugin marketplace
Blueprint packages with:
- Manifest
- Permissions
- Tests
- Sandbox
- Signing

## Autonomy Loop (The Living System)
This is how SWARMZ improves itself.

```txt
Sensors -> Partner plans -> Shadow executes -> Policy checks ->
Resources -> Memory -> Reflection -> Variant generation -> A/B tests -> Promotion
```

Sensors include:
- Sales
- Refunds
- Support
- Delays
- Spend
- Conversion
- Blueprint performance

This loop runs continuously.

## Final Build Order (Start -> Finish)
```txt
PHASE 0 — Runtime foundation
PHASE 1 — LangGraph orchestration
PHASE 2 — Agent layer
PHASE 3 — Partner + Shadow
PHASE 4 — Blueprint system
PHASE 5 — Store + checkout
PHASE 6 — Fulfillment
PHASE 7 — Ledger + credits
PHASE 8 — Control layer
PHASE 9 — Enterprise layer
PHASE 10 — Autonomy + evolution
```

## One-line summary for the agent
Build SWARMZ as a governed, embodied, evolving AI runtime with a Partner assistant, a Shadow executor lane, a multi-agent LangGraph core, a blueprint-to-product factory, a full commerce + fulfillment pipeline, a ledger spine, a policy engine, and a continuous autonomy loop that improves through sensors, memory, reflection, and controlled evolution.
