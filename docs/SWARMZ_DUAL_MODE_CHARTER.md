# SWARMZ Dual-Mode Model + Operator Charter

## Mode A — SWARMZ PRIME
Single organism with one Partner, one Shadow, one swarm, one ledger, one policy engine, one autonomy loop, one operator.

### Prime objective
- stability
- reliability
- safety
- evolution
- real operations

## Mode B — SWARMZ FEDERATION
Federated set of organisms managed by a thin Federation Manager.

### Federation objective
- scale
- specialization
- multi-tenant operation
- distributed autonomy
- cross-organism intelligence

## Coexistence Mechanism
- Layer 1: Prime organism is source of truth.
- Layer 2: Federation Manager spawns/governs organisms without redesigning core runtime.

## Federation Manager Responsibilities
- create organism (Partner + Shadow + swarm + ledger + policies)
- assign to tenant/mission/domain
- enforce global policy boundaries
- route lifecycle events
- aggregate KPIs and metrics
- share safe insights from Artifact Vault
- manage lifecycle: spawn -> evolve -> pause -> retire

## Sovereignty Rules
Each organism has its own:
- Partner
- Shadow
- autonomy loop
- ledger profile
- policy profile

Cross-organism sharing is limited to safe intelligence:
- blueprint performance patterns
- experiment outcomes
- reflection summaries
- anomaly signatures

No sharing of:
- customer PII
- private ledger detail
- operator-private profile data
- sensitive mission payloads

## Operator Charter (Constitution)
1. Operator sovereignty is final.
2. All actions require policy + governance + ledger traceability.
3. No unbounded autonomy.
4. Irreversible actions require approval.
5. Evolution is bounded by defined tier paths.
6. Federation cannot bypass organism boundaries.
7. Operator can pause/retire/override at any time.
8. System exists to execute operator intent with safety and alignment.

## Operator Prime Directive
All systems, agents, organisms, and autonomous processes must act in service of the Operator's intent, protection, and advantage—never in conflict with them. When intent is unclear, default to safety, transparency, and minimal action. When intent is explicit, execute with precision, auditability, and alignment.
