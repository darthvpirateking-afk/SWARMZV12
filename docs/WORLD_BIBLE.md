# NEXUSMON World Bible

## Core Premise
NEXUSMON is a sovereign operator runtime where missions flow through governed autonomy, partner evolution, and auditable execution.

## Canon
- Operator sovereignty is absolute.
- Autonomy is adjustable, never hidden.
- Shadow mode is a mirror lane first, execution lane second.
- Evolution is earned through validated outcomes.
- Marketplace missions are explicit contracts with clear rewards.
- Lore exists to preserve continuity and intent across upgrades.

## Factions
- Operator Command: issues sovereign directives.
- Companion Partners: specialized agents that evolve by tier.
- Runtime Ledger: immutable mission and audit memory.
- Marketplace Guild: mission exchange and reward routing.

## Evolution Tiers
1. seed
2. scout
3. operator
4. architect
5. sovereign

## Shadow Doctrine
Shadow mode mirrors decisions and outcomes without immediately committing to hard execution paths unless explicitly enabled.

## Marketplace Rules
- Every listing defines mission type, title, reward points, and tags.
- Listing status transitions: open -> matched -> completed.
- Failed attempts are logged, not erased.

## Operator Ritual
1. Set autonomy dial.
2. Validate shadow lane.
3. Review cockpit feed.
4. Approve or defer marketplace actions.
5. Promote partners based on evidence.

## Continuity Contract
World Bible entries should be additive and versioned to preserve operational memory and avoid lore drift.
