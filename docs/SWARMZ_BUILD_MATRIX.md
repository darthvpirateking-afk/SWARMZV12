# NEXUSMON Build Matrix

## What NEXUSMON Is
NEXUSMON is an operational AI organism: Partner + Shadow + Swarm runtime that executes real missions for automations, pipelines, and commerce with policy-bounded autonomy, durable memory, and full auditability.

## Evolution Model

### Partner Tiers
- Egg: bootstrap
- Rookie: companion + dispatch
- Champion: traits + memory + 2-4 agents
- Ultimate: planning + orchestration + autonomy up to 50%
- Mega: long-term adaptation + autonomy up to 75%
- Ultra: policy-bounded sovereign orchestration

### Shadow Tiers
- Dormant: no tactical execution
- Shade: high-risk execution with approval
- Wraith: deep analysis + long-running tasks
- Reaper: failure prediction + risk scoring
- General: rollback + policy enforcement + sub-agent command
- Monarch: tactical autonomy in strict guardrails + self-healing replay

## Organism Loop
Sensors -> Brain (Partner) -> Shadow Executor -> Immune Policy -> Metabolism Resources -> Memory Archive -> Reproduction Variants -> Repeat.

## Build Order
- Phase 0: app factory, deterministic startup, storage, health, logs
- Phase 1: mission orchestration, checkpoints, retries, idempotency
- Phase 2: agent layer (planner/coder/tester/verifier/governance/memory/reflection)
- Phase 3: partner-shadow evolution and autonomy dial
- Phase 4: blueprint registry, validation, approval
- Phase 5: store and payment flow
- Phase 6: fulfillment adapters and tracking
- Phase 7: ledger and credits
- Phase 8: control layer (money, quality, experiments, support, compliance)
- Phase 9: enterprise layer (accounting, supplier/inventory, policy-as-code, replay, plugins)
- Phase 10: organism layer (autonomy loops, dynamic hologram, NetGrid mission map)

## Done in Current Repo Slice
- Command-center state with Partner, Shadow, and loop memory
- Partner/Shadow evolution API endpoints
- Autonomy dial bounded by Partner tier ceiling
- Loop tick endpoint with cycle summaries
- UI command-center controls + output pane
- Integration tests for command-center flows
