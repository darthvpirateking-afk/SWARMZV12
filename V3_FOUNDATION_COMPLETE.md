# 🚀 SWARMZ V3.0 ENGINE FRAMEWORK - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## ✅ PHASE 1: FOUNDATION LAYER SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED

### 🏗️ Core Architecture Delivered

**1. Base Engine Framework** ([engines/base_engine.py](engines/base_engine.py))
- ✅ **EngineType** enum for all 7 engine types 
- ✅ **EngineState** management (INITIALIZING, ACTIVE, DEGRADED, OFFLINE, MAINTENANCE)
- ✅ **OperatorMode** sovereignty levels (SOVEREIGN, ASSISTED, AUTONOMOUS, LOCKED)
- ✅ **EngineMessage** standardized inter-engine communication
- ✅ **BaseEngine** abstract class with audit logging and throne protocol
- ✅ **EngineManager** for multi-engine coordination
- ✅ **ThroneProtocol** for absolute operator sovereignty

**2. Intelligence Engine** ([engines/intelligence_engine.py](engines/intelligence_engine.py))
- ✅ **Chain-of-thought reasoning** with rule-based critique
- ✅ **Memory lattice** management system 
- ✅ **Multi-model routing** capabilities
- ✅ **Context stitching** across conversations
- ✅ **Enhanced companion integration** with existing SWARMZ
- ✅ **Operator sovereignty controls** with reasoning depth override

**3. Engine Manager** ([engines/__init__.py](engines/__init__.py))
- ✅ **Global coordination** across all engines
- ✅ **Message routing** between engines
- ✅ **Health monitoring** system-wide
- ✅ **Throne command execution** for operator control
- ✅ **Audit trail logging** for all operations
