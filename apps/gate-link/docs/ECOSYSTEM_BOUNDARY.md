# GATE//LINK Dual-Layer Safety Boundary

## Layer 1 (Real token ecosystem)

- Community identity, governance voting, cosmetic/community access.
- No gameplay power and no direct game-economy exchange.

## Layer 2 (Game economy)

- Fictional in-game currency: `Data Shards`.
- Used for partner progression, army upgrades, chips, and base systems.

## Implementation rule

- Gameplay code must never require wallet/token state for combat power.
- Any future community integration is metadata/access only.

## Current MVP status

- Fully local gameplay progression.
- No blockchain dependency in game runtime.
